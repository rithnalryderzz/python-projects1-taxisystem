Taxi system Python Projects 
 
I built these projects to practise Python fundamentals, problem-solving,
and basic security concepts while learning how real-world systems work.

Simple Taxi Booking System

What I built
A command-line taxi booking system that calculates the total fare based on the
distance travelled.

The program asks the user for the distance in kilometres and then calculates
the final cost using a base fare and a cost per kilometre.

Why I built it
I wanted to practise:
- Taking user input
- Using variables and calculations
- Displaying clear output to the user

This project helped me understand how simple programs can model real-world
services like transport systems.

Skills used
- Python basics
- Variables and data types
- User input and output
- Simple calculations

Password Strength Checker

 What I built
A password strength checker that tells the user whether a password is **weak**,
**medium**, or **strong** based on common security rules.

The program checks:
- Password length
- Uppercase letters
- Lowercase letters
- Numbers
- Special characters

 Why I built it
I am interested in cybersecurity, and this project helped me understand
what makes a password secure and why weak passwords are a risk.

It also helped me practise logical thinking and writing conditions in Python.

 Skills used
- Python logic and conditions
- Regular expressions
- Cybersecurity fundamentals
- Input validation

 Password Generator

 What I built

A password generator that creates a random, secure password based on a length
chosen by

What I did to improve

I later improved this project by adding input validation, taxi types,
and functions to make the code more structured and realistic.
